# Face-and-Smile-detection
#Implemented a program which detects the face and if the smile in the image provided by the videocapture device in real time.
#It uses pretrained Haar cascade models to detect faces and a smile in an image.
#It draws a rectangle frame for the face using opencv and puts text "Smile:)" on the top left corner of the frame.
#As soon as the system detects a smile on the image it replaces the text "Smile" with "Beautiful\(^.^)/".
